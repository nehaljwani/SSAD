1. Hello Team 18! This is the repo that we will be using for the SSAD project. All the php codes will be pushed here. 
2. Please create yoru own github accounts and send me your usernames (So that I can add you as collaborators). 
   Also submit your ssh keys so that you can also make changes.
3. Also create a bastabase named SSAD on your local machines. For concurrent updatation of database files, we shall 
   create an dump file of the database and commit it.

That's all for now. Ankush will be sending php tutorial links to all the three teams. Please go though them.
Further communications will be through ra_ssad@googlegroups.com
